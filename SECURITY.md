# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy for Smart Agriculture System

We take security seriously in the Smart Agriculture System project. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities for our comprehensive agricultural platform that includes crop recommendation, price prediction, marketplace, and real-time communication features.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Methods

1. **Email (Preferred)**

    - **Email**: iddhidasanayaka@gmail.com
    - **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability
    - **Encryption**: Use our PGP key if available

2. **GitHub Security Advisory**
    - Use GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
    - This ensures the report is handled privately

-   **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat model updates for agricultural data
-   **API Security Testing**: Manual testing of API endpoints
-   **ML Model Security**: Security testing of prediction models

## üìã Vulnerability Disclosure

### Disclosure Process

1. **Private Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Investigation**: Security team investigates and validates across all components
3. **Fix Development**: Fix is developed and tested for Frontend, Backend, and ML components
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Fix is released with disclosure
5. **Public Disclosure**: Vulnerability is publicly disclosed after fix deployment

### Disclosure Timeline

-   **0-30 days**: Private investigation and fix development
